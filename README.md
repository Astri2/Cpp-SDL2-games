# Cpp-SDL2-games

A few games made in C++ with a modified version of the SDL2 library.

To play them, you will have to download the release folder and execute the .exe file of the game you want to play.
The .dll may be useless if you already have them.
You will also need the Visual C++ Redistributable. You can download it here : https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145
